### historical notes
This [Github repository](https://github.com/merge/xf86-input-tslib)
builds upon the former
[source location at Pengutronix.](http://public.pengutronix.de/software/xf86-input-tslib/)
(Thanks for hosting and all your development!)
Development and main source distribution is now done on Github. It would be
*awesome*, if Pengutronix would mirror future tarball releases, and thus
provide backwards compatibility for downstream users.
