### historical notes
In cooperation with [Pengutronix](http://pengutronix.de/index_en.html), this
[Github repository](https://github.com/merge/xf86-input-tslib) builds upon the
former
[source distribution.](http://public.pengutronix.de/software/xf86-input-tslib/)
(Thanks Pengutronix, for hosting and all your awesome development work!)
Development and main source distribution is now done on Github. In case
Pengutronix continues mirroring future tarball releases, and thus provides
backwards compatibility for downstream users: Thanks for your help :)
